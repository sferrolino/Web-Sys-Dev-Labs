<h2 align="center">Making an Appealing Webpage</h2>
<h2 align="center">FRONTEND (VueJS)</h2>
<div style="width:90%; padding: 5%; align:center;">
  <p>There are many different aspects that go into making an appealing webpage: format, visual appeal, usage
  of elements, etc. The framework we decided to use for our webpage was VueJS.VueJS provided us with many 
  different types components that we were able to incorporate into our webpage. We were able to use the v-for 
  component for several different aspects for our page, this includes: create ordered/unordered lists and 
  tables.It was fairly easy to implement these components; below I've attached our code. With v-for we were 
  able to create a simple array of our tips and tricks in both an ordered or unordered list.</p>

  <br>
  <p>Here we were able to implement the same v-for component to create a table for our 'Most Cost Effective
  Crop per Season'. This is very beginner friendly and saved us a lot of lines of code. Instead of creating
  an element for each list object, you can easily implement it in a simple array.</p>

  <br>
  <p>The next aspect of creating an appealing webpage is pictures. Similar to HTML/CSS we were able to
  include images using the <img src=""> element. These images don't have to be saved locally from your
  computer but can be taken off any website off Google. In our CSS style sheet we created a fixed format
  for all our pictures which. These classes can be toggled to your liking; using attributes such as width,
  height, display and margins.</p>

  <br>
  <p>Another important part of creating a good looking webpage is to ensure everything is formatted properly
  to the user on any given platform. The code snippet below is one of the few inline style sheets we created
  for our iframe (video) object. We were able to align the video to the center of the page and toggle with them
  margins, width and height to our desired liking. You can feel free to add other attributes as well.<p>

  <!-- CONCLUDING STATEMENT -->
  <p>And with that, you've learned the basic how-to's on how to create a simple yet appealing webpage! Using
  VueJS elements along with basic HTML/CSS.</p>
