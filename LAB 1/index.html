        The Akatsuki is a group of rogue shinobi found in the anime Naruto Shippuden that act as antagonists against our heroes.
</p><p>All of them played an essential role to the Shippuden series with their individual powers and backstories and so I ranked them accordingly, based on my own criteria.</p></div>

<ol>
        <li>Itachi - Great character development 10/10.</li>

        <li>Pain - Dramatic arc, defeated by talk no jutsu 9/10 angsty teen.</li>

        <li>Deidara - I like his hair.</li>
